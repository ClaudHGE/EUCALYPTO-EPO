# EUCALYPTO-EPO
The Eucalypt Phenology Ontology (EPO) is an ontology that describes the reproductive phenology of _Eucalyptus_ species, especially those of the subgenus _Eucalyptus_ but it could be useful for other taxa. The EPO builds upon the Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO) and the Plant Ontology (PO) by incorporating a narrower set of reproductive structures (continuant entities) that can be linked to phenological stages and plant phenological traits. 

EPO aims to standardize and organize knowledge about the eucalypt reproductive structures and stages to facilitate data integration, analysis and communication among students, researchers, practitioners, foresters, and ecologists.

This ontology is linked to the article "Definition of reproductive structures in Eucalyptus for phenological data collection" by [Giraldo Escobar et. al. (2024)](https://rdcu.be/d0gS4)
